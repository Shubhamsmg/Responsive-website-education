                Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. There are many debates about
                its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is whether
                part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student is an improvement. Some researchers
                stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. These disagreements
                affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The term can also refer to the mental
                states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the academic field studying
                education.

                Education socializes children into society by teaching cultural values and norms. It equips them with
                the skills needed to become productive members of society. This way, it stimulates economic growth and
                raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions affect many aspects of education.
                For example, governments set education policies. They determine when school classes happen, what is
                taught, and who can or must attend. International organizations, like UNESCO, have been influential in
                promoting primary education for all children.

                The main field investigating education is called education studies. It examines what education is and
                what aims it has. It also studies how it happens, what effects it has, and how to improve it. It has
                many subfields, like philosophy of education, psychology of education, sociology of education, economics
                of education, and comparative education. It also discusses the history of education. In prehistory,
                education happened informally through oral communication and imitation. With the rise of ancient
                civilizations, writing was invented, and the amount of knowledge grew. This caused a shift from informal
                to formal education.
